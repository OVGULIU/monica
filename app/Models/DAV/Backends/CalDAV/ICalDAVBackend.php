     * Returns all calendar objects within a calendar.
     *
     * Every item contains an array with the following keys:
     *   * calendardata - The iCalendar-compatible calendar data
     *   * uri - a unique key which will be used to construct the uri. This can
     *     be any arbitrary string, but making sure it ends with '.ics' is a
     *     good idea. This is only the basename, or filename, not the full
     *     path.
     *   * lastmodified - a timestamp of the last modification time
     *   * etag - An arbitrary string, surrounded by double-quotes. (e.g.:
     *   '"abcdef"')
     *   * size - The size of the calendar objects, in bytes.
     *   * component - optional, a string containing the type of object, such
     *     as 'vevent' or 'vtodo'. If specified, this will be used to populate
     *     the Content-Type header.
     *
     * Note that the etag is optional, but it's highly encouraged to return for
     * speed reasons.
     *
     * The calendardata is also optional. If it's not returned
     * 'getCalendarObject' will be called later, which *is* expected to return
     * calendardata.
     *
     * If neither etag or size are specified, the calendardata will be
     * used/fetched to determine these numbers. If both are specified the
     * amount of times this is needed is reduced by a great degree.
